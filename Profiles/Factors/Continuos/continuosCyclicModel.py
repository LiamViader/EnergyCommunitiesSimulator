class ContinuosCyclicModel():
    """
    A model representing a continuous cyclic process or device that alternates between active and idle states.

    This class encapsulates the behavior of devices or systems that operate in cycles, with defined power consumption
    during both active and idle phases. The model also defines the duration of these phases and the time between cycles.

    Attributes:
        _name (str): The name of the cyclic model, representing the device or process.
        _idlePower (BaseNumberDistribution): The power consumption (in kW) when the device is idle.
        _activePower (BaseNumberDistribution): The power consumption (in kW) when the device is active.
        _timeBetweenCycles (BaseNumberDistribution): The time (in hours) between the end of one cycle and the start of the next.
        _cycleDuration (BaseNumberDistribution): The duration of the active cycle (in hours).

    Methods:
        get_active_power() -> float:
            Returns the power consumption during the active phase.
        get_idle_power() -> float:
            Returns the power consumption during the idle phase.
        get_name() -> str:
            Returns the name of the cyclic model.
        get_time_between_next_cycle() -> float:
            Returns the time between the current and next cycle (in hours).
        get_cycle_duration() -> float:
            Returns the duration of the active cycle (in hours).
