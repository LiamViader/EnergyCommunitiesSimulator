class Wind:
    """
    Simulates wind speed variations over a day.

    This class generates wind speed data for each time step of a day based on seasonal patterns and provides methods
    to retrieve and change the simulated wind data.

    Attributes:
        _wind (np.ndarray): An array of wind speed values for each time step of the day.

        _indices (int): The number of indices representing time intervals of the day.
        
        _currentDate (date): The current date used to determine the season for wind speed simulation.

    Methods:
        simulate_wind() -> None:
            Generates wind speed data for each hour of the day and interpolates it across the specified indices.

        get_wind() -> np.ndarray:
            Returns the simulated wind speed data.

        change_date(date: date) -> None:
            Changes the current date and re-simulates the wind speed data based on the new date.

        get_season() -> str:
            Determines the current season based on the current date.
    Notes:
        - To use real wind data, implement a method to read wind data for the day whenever the date changes,
          and store the values in the `_wind` attribute.
        - The wind simulation uses a really basic model and does not take into account the geolocation.
